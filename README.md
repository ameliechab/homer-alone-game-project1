# Why I choose this game ?

The memory game is interesting because of the logic behind it. To challenge myself, I decided to create a new kind of memory : the game will give you a card and you will have to find the same card through a choice of several hidden cards. This way, you will have to guess all the cards but be careful: you have health points...

# Key features

- Randomize cards in an array with a shuffle method.
- Display cards using the DOM.
- splice(): make the cards to guess removing from the array while you guess it.
- Check if pairs or not with the name and the image of the cards
- Display and remove hearts with DOM
- Game over or win alert with modal
